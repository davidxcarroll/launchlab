						h3 Problems of doing things the old way
						p The "old way" is direct mail, etc.
						p As most of us would agree, second home properties are discretionary purchases (duh!) and only people with discretionary income are going to buy them. This means that highly targeted outreach methods are required. Before the downturn, direct mail (aka snail mail) was the gold standard. This meant merging and purging different targeted mailing lists to reach the right prospects.
						p It also meant designing and producing distinctive and expensive direct mail pieces to ensure they were noticed and not thrown away as junk mail. It was a targeted shotgun approach and was a massive risk – that could cost developers and property owners many tens of thousands of dollars in upfront costs for something that may or may not work. Not very appealing right?
						p However, in the frothy days before the real estate downturn this process was actually considered feasible. No longer. Today’s offerings operate on much tighter marketing budgets...and rightfully so!
						p Fortunately a better way has emerged!

						h3 Nationwide Facebook Ad Campaign to Consumers
						p After profiling the psychographic and demographic of our target prospects, we apply corresponding filters. Next, we define target geographic, such as direct flight patterns.
						p They were so pleased with the results of the first test that they decided to have us develop a national ads campaign targeting buyers this time instead of realtors.
						p #[strong The goal:] Set at least 10 appointments per month for buyers to fly to Florida to tour the property and hopefully buy.
						p #[strong The hook:] In order to get buyers motivated to hop on a plane and head down we presented them with a limited availability offer of $499 for a 4 day 3 night stay.
						p The ads converted poorly at first. Initially, our sales funnel looked like this.
						p We showed them this ad:

						p Then we showed them this landing page where we attempted to sell them on the stay and play event. Basically, four days three nights at the resort with activities and personal tours for low price of only $499 per couple.

						p After a few hundred visits and only 4 leads we decided to switch it up. 
						p Our new lead funnel focused on educating the potential buyer and then selling them a discovery trip AFTER we’ve qualified them. To do that we used an ad with a lead, to be filled out by the prospect, instead of an ad that clicked through to a website. The lead forms are a SUPER effective way to gather leads. Usually for 50% less than traditional clicks to a website or landing page.

						h3 But Why?
						p Buyers don’t have to leave Facebook.
						p Contrary to popular belief potential buyers don’t go on Facebook hoping to find their dream properties. They go on Facebook to see what their friends are up to. Your ads are an interruption to their social experience. Accept that. By using a lead form, once “Learn More” is clicked a popup appears instead of linking them to a landing page off of Facebook.
						p The prospect’s contact info is auto-filled because another key feature is auto-filled text. Facebook already knows your name, email, phone, the city you live, etc. So, when you as an advertiser ask for this information it is automatically filled in. The reason this matters is MOST of the traffic on Facebook is via mobile. To ask a potential buyer to fill out a form on their mobile device is asking a lot. But, if their info is already auto-filled and all they have to do is hit enter, it’s a win-win for everyone. Make sense?

						h3 You’ve Got Leads... Now What?
						p Leads are one thing; sales are another.
						p In order to qualify the leads that were coming in we did a 3 part sales funnel on the backend. The process looked like this:
						ol
							li Potential buyer sees ad
							li Potential buyer clicks learn more and we capture their name, email, phone, and location.
							li An email is sent out immediately showing amenities, floor plans, pictures and more.
							li Another email goes out on the second day with video and a link to a special offer to visit the property at a discounted price.
							li The potential buyer clicks the link, sees the offer and has to enter their information in again.
							li We receive these leads and send immediately to the sales director with subject line “HOT LEAD” and the sales team books the trip.
							li NOTE: To add urgency, on the landing page we inform the potential buyers that only 10 trips per month will be booked at this special discounted price. 
						p This funnels started converting like crazy! Literally 1500 leads in two weeks. The onsite team started to get overwhelmed with making calls and appointments rather than showing and selling properties.

						h3 Enter the Hired Gun
						p (Actually our telemarketing department)
						p For this reason we put an inside sales professional on the project. The funnel stayed the same but to insure our sales execs worked only the hottest lead, our inside sales reps called the lead, qualified the lead, and then booked the trip for the buyer to head down to see the property in person.
						p This accomplished two things:
						ol
							li The buyer was getting contacted within hours instead of days.
							li The onsite realtors were able to focus on selling instead of prospecting.
						p I hope this case study has shown you what is possible with some creativity and a plan. If you have a real estate project and need sales and Marketing expertise we’d like to hear from you. We have the secret sauce!
